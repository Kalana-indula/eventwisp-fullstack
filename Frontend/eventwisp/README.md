This is a user-friendly web-based platform designed to simplify event planning and execution. This app aligns with modern needs for efficient event organization in the hospitality and event industries.
It tackles common challenges like fragmented ticketing, scheduling, and attendance tracking by integrating everything into one dashboard. Organizers can create events, manage schedules, set ticket types, and handle registrations seamlessly. Attendees enjoy easy ticket purchases, secure payments via gateways like Stripe or PayPal, and real-time updates.
Key features include:

Event Creation and Management: Set up sessions, venues, and resources with ease.
Ticketing and Registration: Online sales with digital tickets and email confirmations.
Attendance Tracking: Real-time check-ins and capacity monitoring.
Analytics Dashboard: Insights on sales, demographics, and finances for better decisions.

Developed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL for secure data storage, the system ensures scalability for small workshops to large concerts. It reduces costs, boosts revenue through promotions, and enhances satisfaction for organizers and attendees.
